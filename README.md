### Hi there, I'm Juliana!

I am a dedicated Analyst with over a decade of experience in strategic planning and business process improvement. My thirst for knowledge has led me into the realm of data analysis, where I have honed my critical thinking skills and become proficient in tools such as Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI.

Currently, I proudly serve as a Data Analyst in a project-oriented role, where I apply my expertise to drive data-driven insights.

I am also open to exploring new opportunities where I can utilise my strong business acumen to unearth impactful insights that elevate the planning process and equip stakeholders with well-informed decision-making guidance.

This journey has been nothing short of extraordinary, and if you're interested in learning more about my background, I invite you to explore my portfolio and professional history.
