### Hi there, I am Juliana

Having accumulated over a decade of business planning experience, my innate thirst for knowledge steered me towards the realm of data analysis. This amalgamation empowered me to refine my critical thinking abilities and proficiently wield tools such as Excel, SQL, Python, and PowerBI.

Presently, I proudly assume the role of a data analyst, leveraging my business acumen to unearth powerful insights that enrich the planning process and provide clients with well-informed decision-making guidance.

This journey has been nothing short of extraordinary, and if you're interested in delving deeper into my background, I invite you to explore my portfolio and experiences.
