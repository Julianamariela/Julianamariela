### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Juliana

With over 10 years of experience in consulting and business planning, my innate drive for learning led me to combine my experience with the world data analysis. This fusion allowed me to enhance my critical thinking skills and master tools like Excel, SQL, Python, and PowerBI.

Today, I stand as a data analyst, utilizing my business knowledge to uncover potent insights that elevate planning and guide clients in making informed decisions. 
					
This journey has been incredible, and if you would like to know more about me, please have a look at my experiences and portfolio.
